# React Portfolio Overiew

This is a portfolio I created using React. It uses react-mdl as the framework. 

# Home Page

The Home page has navigation links in the top right and in the side panel that link to other areas of my portfolio. In my landing page I include my Bitmoji, title, coding languages and software I've become familiar with, as well as links to my social media.

# Projects Page

The Projects page is where I order projects based on the code. The GitPages tab just shows simple javascript applications I've built. The mySQL tab shows a project built using mySQL. MongoDB shows an app where I used MongoDB as a database. Finally, the React tab shows another project that was built using React.

# Contact Page

The Contact page shows a real photo of me with a mini bio. It then lists my phone number, email, and has a a button to download my resume.
